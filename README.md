## Our Path

### Robot Development Process

This project involved testing multiple hardware platforms to determine the most efficient and stable system for our robot. Each platform was evaluated based on performance, reliability, integration ability, and real-time processing. Here is a detailed explanation of our journey and the reasons behind switching from one platform to another.

---

### üîÅ 1. Using Arduino Uno

Initially, we selected the **Arduino Uno** due to its ease of programming, availability, and compatibility with a wide range of sensors and actuators. The decision was also influenced by our prior experience working with Arduino boards in simpler robotic projects. However, as we progressed and tried to scale up the system for competition-level performance, we encountered several critical issues:

- **Camera Limitations**: We experimented with common camera modules like the OV7670 and even the ESP32-CAM via serial relay, but Arduino lacked the computational power and memory to process visual data effectively. The result was low-resolution, slow frame rates, and unreliable object detection.
- **Limited Multitasking**: Arduino's single-threaded loop and limited interrupt management made it extremely difficult to handle real-time sensor reading and motor control simultaneously, which was essential for dynamic environments like WRO.
- **No Native Support for USB Devices**: Integrating vision modules that relied on USB (like Pixy Cam) was not natively supported, which limited expansion possibilities.

After thorough testing, we concluded that Arduino Uno was not suitable for vision-integrated robotics and began searching for a more powerful platform.

---

### üîÅ 2. Switching to ESP32

Our second approach was to use the **ESP32**, a microcontroller that offers dual-core processing, integrated Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, and better memory management. This seemed like a strong candidate for balancing sensor control and wireless communication.

- **Pros**:
  - Faster than Arduino with dual-core capabilities
  - Excellent for IoT-based data communication (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)
  - Can theoretically handle simultaneous I/O from sensors and motors

- **Cons**:
  - **Sensor Interference**: When we attempted to drive multiple motors and read sensor data (e.g., ultrasonic or color detection) in real-time, the I2C and PWM signals would become unstable, often introducing jitter or complete loss of feedback.
  - **PWM Conflicts**: The number of reliable PWM channels was limited and required careful GPIO selection. Timing mismatches caused delays in response.
  - **Camera Challenges**: Even with the ESP32-CAM module, integrating vision processing with motor control wasn‚Äôt practically feasible due to RAM bottlenecks and lack of image processing libraries in MicroPython or Arduino ESP32 cores.
  - **Library Limitations**: Most ESP32-compatible camera libraries (e.g., ESP-IDF CAM or Arduino-based ESP32-CAM libraries) are not optimized for parallel sensor/motor tasks, especially in real-time robotics.


Eventually, the technical instability forced us to abandon the ESP32 setup despite its attractive specs on paper.

---

### üîÅ 3. Adopting Raspberry Pi Zero

In search of a more powerful yet compact platform, we transitioned to the **Raspberry Pi Zero**, which runs Linux and provides sufficient computational resources to handle camera modules like the Pi Camera and USB peripherals like the Pixy Cam.

- **Advantages**:
  - Full support for Python and OpenCV
  - Ability to use multi-threaded programming
  - Native support for USB and camera modules

- **Challenges**:
  - **Power Sensitivity**: The Raspberry Pi Zero is highly sensitive to voltage drops, especially when multiple peripherals are connected. We experienced brownouts during testing even with power banks and regulated supplies.
  - **Heat Issues**: Continuous camera streaming and motor control led to significant thermal buildup, which affected stability.
  - **Hardware Fragility**: Despite all precautions, we burned two Raspberry Pi Zero boards ‚Äî one due to a short from an incorrectly grounded motor driver, and another due to sudden current surge when powering the camera and motors simultaneously.

These hardware failures prompted us to reconsider the ruggedness of the Raspberry Pi platform for field use in competitions.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Final Transition to LEGO EV3

Given all previous difficulties and our positive past experiences, we decided to return to the **LEGO EV3 Mindstorms** system. All team members were already familiar with it from previous WRO competitions, and it offered unmatched integration, safety, and stability.

- **Stability & Robustness**: The EV3 Intelligent Brick is designed for rugged educational environments and can safely manage motors and sensors without external drivers.
- **Built-in Motor/Sensor Ports**: Four motor ports and four sensor ports eliminate the need for extra circuitry and reduce risk of hardware failure.
- **Pixy Cam Integration**: With minor custom wiring, the Pixy Cam could be integrated via I2C through an EV3 sensor port, removing the need for USB host support or voltage converters.
- **Development Efficiency**: Using LEGO‚Äôs native block-based software or Python (via ev3dev/pybricks), we could rapidly develop and test behaviors without the delays we faced with bare-metal microcontrollers.
- **Competition-Proven**: The EV3 platform has been used extensively in WRO, and many open-source libraries and sensor solutions are readily available.

---

### üìå Final Summary & Reflection

Each platform taught us unique lessons about system design, integration challenges, and performance trade-offs, ultimately guiding us toward the most reliable solution. While Arduino and ESP32 were simpler to program, and Raspberry Pi offered more processing power, **only EV3 delivered the right balance of stability, expandability, and safety for WRO 2025**.

> This final transition was not a fallback, but a strategic return to a battle-tested platform that ensured our team could focus on **strategy and performance** instead of constantly troubleshooting hardware issues.

## Code for Each Component

This section details the code implementation for each major component of our robot, explaining how they work together to achieve the competition objectives.

### Drive Motor Code

The drive motor (Motor B) is responsible for propelling the robot forward and backward. It uses a proportional control system to maintain consistent speed and respond to commands from the obstacle management system.

```python
from ev3dev2.motor import MediumMotor, OUTPUT_B, SpeedPercent

# Initialize the drive motor
motor_b = MediumMotor(OUTPUT_B)

def drive_forward(speed_percent):
    """
    Function to drive the robot forward at a specified speed.
    Args:
        speed_percent (int): Speed percentage from 1 to 100
    """
    motor_b.on(speed_percent)

def drive_backward(speed_percent):
    """
    Function to drive the robot backward at a specified speed.
    Args:
        speed_percent (int): Speed percentage from 1 to 100
    """
    motor_b.on(-speed_percent)

def stop_drive():
    """Function to stop the drive motor."""
    motor_b.off()
```
**Implementation Notes:**
- The drive motor operates on a simple on/off principle with speed control
- We found that 60% speed provides optimal balance between stability and performance
- For precise maneuvers, we use `on_for_degrees()` or `on_for_rotations()` methods

### Steering Motor Code
The steering motor (Motor A) controls the robot's direction by adjusting the front wheels. It implements a proportional control algorithm for smooth and accurate steering.
```python
from ev3dev2.motor import MediumMotor, OUTPUT_B, OUTPUT_D, SpeedPercent

# Initialize the steering motor
motor_a = MediumMotor(OUTPUT_B)
motor_a.reset()

def clamp(value, minimum, maximum):
    """
    Utility function to limit a value between minimum and maximum bounds.
    Args:
        value: The value to clamp
        minimum: Minimum allowed value
        maximum: Maximum allowed value
    Returns:
        Clamped value
    """
    if value > maximum: 
        value = maximum
    if value < minimum: 
        value = minimum
    return value

def amotor(degrees, cl=50):
    """
    Function to control steering motor with proportional control.
    Args:
        degrees: Target position in degrees
        cl: Control limit for maximum power (default 50)
    """
    diff = degrees - motor_a.position
    diff = clamp(diff, -cl, cl)  
    motor_a.on(diff)
```
**Control Algorithm Explanation:**
The steering system uses a proportional control algorithm where the motor power is directly proportional to the difference between the target angle and current position. This provides smooth, oscillation-free steering adjustments.

### Pixy Camera Code
The Pixy camera is our primary sensor for detecting red and green pillars in the obstacle challenge. It communicates with the EV3 brick via I2C protocol.
```python
from ev3dev2.sensor import Sensor, INPUT_1

# Initialize Pixy sensor
pixy = Sensor(INPUT_1)
pixy.mode = 'ALL'

def get_pillar_data():
    """
    Function to read data from Pixy camera.
    Returns:
        tuple: (signature, x_position, y_position, size)
    """
    sig = pixy.value(1) * 256 + pixy.value(0)  # Color signature
    x = pixy.value(2)  # X position
    y = pixy.value(3)  # Y position  
    size = pixy.value(4)  # Size of detected object
    
    return sig, x, y, size

def detect_pillar():
    """
    Main function for pillar detection and response.
    Returns:
        int: 1 for red pillar, 2 for green pillar, 0 for no pillar
    """
    sig, x, y, size = get_pillar_data()
    
    # Filter out detections that are too far (low Y value)
    if y < 75:
        sig = 0
        
    return sig
```
**Detection Strategy:**
- The Pixy is programmed to recognize two color signatures: red (signature 1) and green (signature 2)
- We filter detections based on Y-position to avoid false positives from distant objects
- The X-position is used to calculate steering corrections

### Color Sensor Code
The color sensor detects the colored lines on the track, which determine the robot's turning direction in the open challenge.
```python
from ev3dev2.sensor.lego import ColorSensor
from ev3dev2.sensor import INPUT_4

# Initialize color sensor
color_sensor = ColorSensor(INPUT_4)

def get_track_color():
    """
    Function to read the current track color.
    Returns:
        int: Color code (2=Green, 5=Red, 6=White, etc.)
    """
    return color_sensor.color

def wait_for_color(target_color):
    """
    Function to wait until a specific color is detected.
    Args:
        target_color (int): Color code to wait for
    """
    current_color = get_track_color()
    while current_color != target_color:
        current_color = get_track_color()
        sleep(0.01)  # Small delay to prevent excessive CPU usage
```
**Color Detection Logic:**
- The robot uses color detection to determine when to start turning
- Green line (color code 2) triggers a left turn sequence
- Red line (color code 5) triggers a right turn sequence

### LED Indicator Code
The EV3 brick's LEDs provide visual feedback about the robot's state and detected obstacles.
```python
from ev3dev2.led import Leds

# Initialize LEDs
leds = Leds()

def set_led_state(state):
    """
    Function to set LED colors based on robot state.
    Args:
        state (str): 'idle', 'red_pillar', 'green_pillar', 'turning'
    """
    if state == 'idle':
        leds.set_color('LEFT', 'ORANGE')
        leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'ORANGE')
    elif state == 'red_pillar':
        leds.set_color('LEFT', 'GREEN')
        leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'GREEN')
    elif state == 'green_pillar':
        leds.set_color('LEFT', 'RED')
        leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'RED')
    elif state == 'turning':
        leds.set_color('LEFT', 'AMBER')
        leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'AMBER')
```
**LED State Logic:**
- Orange: Robot is in idle/normal driving mode
- Green: Red pillar detected, preparing for right turn
- Red: Green pillar detected, preparing for left turn
- Amber: Robot is executing a turn maneuver

### Ultrasonic Sensor Code
We use two ultrasonic sensors (left and right) for wall following and distance measurement.
```python
from ev3dev2.sensor.lego import UltrasonicSensor
from ev3dev2.sensor import INPUT_2, INPUT_3

# Initialize ultrasonic sensors
rast = UltrasonicSensor(INPUT_2)  # Right sensor
chap = UltrasonicSensor(INPUT_3)  # Left sensor

def get_distances():
    """
    Function to read distances from both ultrasonic sensors.
    Returns:
        tuple: (right_distance, left_distance) in centimeters
    """
    right_distance = rast.distance_centimeters
    left_distance = chap.distance_centimeters
    return right_distance, left_distance

def wall_following_control():
    """
    Main wall following control algorithm.
    Returns:
        float: Steering correction value
    """
    right_dist, left_dist = get_distances()
    
    # Calculate correction factors using square root function
    # This provides non-linear response for better control
    fr = (-2*(math.sqrt(11*(right_dist)))) + 100
    fc = (-2*(math.sqrt(11*(left_dist)))) + 100
    
    # Combine corrections with weighting
    target = (fc*1.3) - (fr*1.7)
    
    return clamp(target, -50, 50)
```
**Wall Following Algorithm:**
Our wall following system uses a non-linear control function that provides more sensitive response at closer distances. The square root function in our correction algorithm ensures that small distance changes near the wall result in larger steering corrections, while larger distances result in more gradual adjustments.

### Button Control Code
The EV3 button is used to start the robot after manual positioning.
```python
from ev3dev2.button import Button

# Initialize button
btn = Button()

def wait_for_start():
    """
    Function to wait for user to press the center button to start.
    """
    btn.wait_for_bump('enter')
```
**Start Procedure:**
- The robot waits in a holding pattern until the center button is pressed
- This allows for precise manual positioning before autonomous operation begins
- After button press, the robot changes LED color to green to indicate readiness

### Main Control Flow
The main program integrates all components into a cohesive system:
```python
# Initialize all components
initialize_components()

# Wait for start signal
wait_for_start()
set_led_state('idle')

# Main control loop
while not challenge_complete:
    # Check for color line (Open Challenge)
    current_color = get_track_color()
    
    # Check for pillars (Obstacle Challenge)

## Obstacle Avoidance and Parking Management(Obstacle Management)

The robot‚Äôs mobility is managed through a combination of two medium motors (`motor_a` and `motor_b`) from the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit, selected for their balance of speed, torque, and compatibility with the EV3 platform. `motor_b` drives the robot‚Äôs forward and backward motion, while `motor_a` controls steering, enabling precise navigation and turning. The motors were chosen for their ability to deliver sufficient torque for navigating the obstacle course and performing the parking sequence, while maintaining energy efficiency for prolonged operation.

The chassis is a modular LEGO EV3 structure, designed for stability and ease of component integration. The motors are mounted on a reinforced baseplate to ensure durability during high-speed navigation and obstacle avoidance. The steering mechanism uses a rack-and-pinion system, driven by `motor_a`, to achieve smooth and controlled turns. The chassis design prioritizes a low center of gravity to prevent tipping during sharp turns or sudden stops, as seen in the parking sequence.

Engineering principles such as speed and torque were considered in the motor control logic. For instance, the `motor_b.on(speed)` function uses variable speed settings (e.g., 20, 40, 60, 70) to balance between fast navigation and precise maneuvers. The `amotor` function implements a PID-like control to adjust steering angles, ensuring accurate alignment with lines and walls. Assembly instructions are provided in the GitHub repository, including a step-by-step guide for mounting motors and sensors, along with STL files for 3D-printed sensor mounts to enhance component stability.

```python
def amotor(degrese, cl=50):
    diff = degrese
    diff = diff - motor_a.position
    diff = clamp(diff, -cl, cl)
    motor_a.on(diff)
```

*Improvements*: To enhance mobility, we optimized the gear ratio for `motor_b` to increase torque during the parking sequence, reducing strain on the motor. Future iterations could include a differential drive system for smoother turns.

### Open Challenge (Qualification Round)

[Full Code](codes/open-challenge-code.py)

In the open challenge, the robot navigates a track using a color sensor (`color_sensor`) to detect lines (blue: `cr1=2`, orange: `cr1=5`) and ultrasonic sensors (`rast` and `chap`) for distance-based steering. The robot determines its initial direction by detecting a line color and then follows a path, making turns when specific colors are detected. It uses a PID-like control for steering (`amotor`) to maintain a target distance (27 cm) from walls, adjusting based on the detected line color.

```python
cr1 = color_sensor.color
while cr1 != 2 and cr1 != 5:
    cr1 = color_sensor.color
    motor_b.on(60)
while g != 60:
    motor_b.on(30)
    r = rast.distance_centimeters
    c = chap.distance_centimeters
    fr = (-2 * (math.sqrt(11 * r))) + 100
    fc = (-2 * (math.sqrt(11 * c))) + 100
    target = (fc * 1.3) - (fr * 1.7)
    amotor(clamp(target, -50, 50))
    g = g + 1
```

#### Line Detection and Navigation
The robot detects blue (`cr1=2`) or orange (`cr1=5`) lines to determine its path. Upon detecting a line, it stops, increments a turn counter (`a`), and resumes navigation. The robot completes 11 turns (`a == 11`) before entering a final straight-line navigation phase, maintaining a 27 cm distance from the wall using the appropriate ultrasonic sensor based on the initial line color.

```python
if cr1 == 2:
    while True:
        cr1 = color_sensor.color
        if cr1 == 2:

### Final Round with Obstacle Avoidance(Obstacle Challenge)

[Full Code](codes/obstacle-challenge-code.py)

In the final round, the robot builds on the open challenge logic by adding obstacle avoidance using a Pixy camera. It determines its initial direction (`al`) by comparing distances from two ultrasonic sensors (`rast` and `chap`) over 100 iterations. The robot then assigns color values (`rang` and `rangdovom`) for line detection and uses the Pixy camera to detect green (`sig=1`) or red (`sig=2`) obstacles, adjusting steering (`target`) based on their position (`x`) relative to predefined offsets (`green` or `red`). LEDs indicate detected obstacles (green for `sig=1`, red for `sig=2`).

```python
p = 0
jahat = 0
while p != 100:
    r = rast.distance_centimeters
    c = chap.distance_centimeters
    if r > c:
        jahat = 1 + jahat
    else:
        jahat = jahat - 1
    p = p + 1
if jahat > 0:
    al = -1
    green = 230
    red = 20
    rang = 5
    rangdovom = 2
else:
    al = 1
    green = 230
    red = 5
    rang = 2
    rangdovom = 5
```

#### Obstacle Detection and Avoidance
When an obstacle is detected, the robot adjusts its speed and steering. If the obstacle is close (`y < 110`), it slows down and tightens steering control. If no obstacle is detected (`sig == 0`), it uses ultrasonic sensors to maintain a dynamic distance (`fasele`) from walls.

```python
if y < 110 and (sig == 1):
    leds.set_color('LEFT', 'GREEN')
    leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'GREEN')
    target = (x - 120) * 0.7
    target = clamp(target, -20, 20)
    amotor(target, 35)
    speed = 40
elif y < 110 and (sig == 2):
    leds.set_color('LEFT', 'RED')
    leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'RED')
    target = (x - 100) * 0.7
    target = clamp(target, -20, 20)
    amotor(target, 35)
    speed = 40
elif sig == 1:
    ghabeliat = True
    target = (x - green) * 0.5
    leds.set_color('LEFT', 'GREEN')
    leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'GREEN')
    amotor(target, 50)
    speed = 22
elif sig == 2:
    ghabeliat = True
    target = (x - red) * 0.5
    leds.set_color('LEFT', 'RED')
    leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'RED')
    amotor(target, 50)
    speed = 22
elif sig == 0 and cr1 == 6:
    leds.all_off()
    speed = 33
    r = rast.distance_centimeters
    c = chap.distance_centimeters
    if al == 1:
        oltra = c
    else:
        oltra = r
    out = (fasele - oltra) * al
    out = clamp(out, -45, 45)
    amotor(out)
```

#### Parking Sequence

After completing the required laps (`a == door`), the robot enters a parking sequence. It aligns with the secondary line color (`rangdovom`) and uses the ultrasonic sensor (`rast`) to maintain a 15 cm distance from the wall. A series of precise motor movements positions the robot correctly within the parking area, ending with a final alignment to stop parallel to the wall.

```python
if al < 0:
    navakht = 90
    while cr1 != rangdovom:
        motor_b.on(30)
        amotor(0)
        cr1 = color_sensor.color
    motor_b.off()
    motor_a.on_for_degrees((100), -120)
    motor_b.on_for_degrees((-30), 300)
    motor_a.on_for_degrees((90), -motor_a.position)
    while True:
        motor_b.on(speed)
        r = rast.distance_centimeters
        if r < 60 or cr1 == rangdovom:
            break
    fasele = 15
    speed = 20
    while motor_b.position < 1500:
        motor_b.on(speed)
        r = rast.distance_centimeters
        out = (fasele - r) * 1.5 * al
        out = clamp(out, -23, 23)
        amotor(out)
    motor_b.off()
    motor_a.on_for_degrees((90), -90)
    motor_b.on_for_rotations(-20, 1.72)
    motor_a.on_for_degrees((90), -motor_a.position)
    motor_b.on_for_rotations(-20, 3.5)
    motor_a.on_for_degrees((90), 90)
    motor_b.on_for_rotations(20, 0.7)
    motor_a.on_for_degrees((90), -190)
    motor_b.on_for_rotations(-20, 0.6)
    motor_a.on_for_degrees((90), 190)
    motor_b.on_for_rotations(20, 0.4)
```

#### Parking Wall Detection
The ultrasonic sensor (`rast`) ensures the robot stays close to the wall during parking, while the color sensor confirms alignment with the parking line (`rangdovom`).

### Additional Functions

#### Steering Control
The `amotor` function provides PID-like steering control, adjusting the motor angle based on the target position. The `clamp` function limits values to prevent oversteering.

```python
def clamp(value, minimum, maximum):
    if value > maximum:
        value = maximum
    if value < minimum:
        value = minimum
    return value

def amotor(degrese, cl=50):
    diff = degrese
    diff = diff - motor_a.position
    diff = clamp(diff, -cl, cl)
    motor_a.on(diff)
```

#### Stall Detection and Recovery
The robot detects stalls by checking if the motor position (`lastpos`) remains unchanged for 0.3 seconds, initiating a recovery sequence by reversing and adjusting steering.

```python
if lastpos == motor_b.position:
    if b_timer == 0:
        b_timer = time.time()
    if time.time() - b_timer > 0.3:
        print("khokafez")
        b_timer = 0
        motor_a.on_for_degrees((40), -motor_a.position)
        motor_b.on_for_rotations(-100, 1)
        motor_a.on_for_degrees((40), 45 * al)
        motor_b.on_for_rotations(100, 0.8)
lastpos = motor_b.position
```

#### Color-Based Navigation
The robot uses the color sensor to detect lines (`rang` and `rangdovom`) for navigation decisions. In the open challenge, it detects blue or orange lines to trigger turns, while in the final round, it uses these colors to navigate and park.

```python
if cr1 == rang:
    fasele = 25
    timeRang = time.time()
    navakht = -40
    while cr1 != rangdovom and sig == 0 and time.time() - timeRang < 4:
        amotor(navakht * al)
        if navakht <= 0:
            navakht = navakht + 1
        motor_b.on(20)
        cr1 = color_sensor.color
    timeRang = time.time()
    while time.time() - timeRang < 0.7 and sig == 0:
        amotor(-20 * al)
        motor_b.on(70)
    if a_timer == 0 or time.time() - a_timer > 4:
        a_timer = time.time()
        a = a + 1
    fasele = 35
```

#### Visual Feedback
LEDs provide visual feedback: green for green obstacles (`sig=1`), red for red obstacles (`sig=2`), and off when navigating without obstacles or during parking.

```python
if sig == 1:
    leds.set_color('LEFT', 'GREEN')
    leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'GREEN')
elif sig == 2:
    leds.set_color('LEFT', 'RED')
    leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'RED')
elif sig == 0 and cr1 == 6:
    leds.all_off()
```

### Notes
- **Robustness**: The combination of ultrasonic sensors, color sensors, and the Pixy camera ensures reliable navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Adaptability**: The direction determination (`al`) and dynamic distance adjustment (`fasele`) allow adaptation to different track orientations.
- **Limitations**: The code assumes consistent lighting for color detection and reliable ultrasonic readings. Variations may require recalibration of thresholds (`green`, `red`, `fasele`).
