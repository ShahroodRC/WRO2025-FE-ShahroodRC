## Our Path

### Robot Development Process

The ShahroodRC team embarked on a rigorous development process to identify the most efficient and reliable platform for our WRO 2025 Future Engineers robot. We tested multiple hardware platforms‚ÄîArduino Uno, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Zero, and LEGO EV3‚Äîevaluating each based on **processing power**, **sensor integration**, **power consumption**, **real-time performance**, and **reliability** in competition environments. Below is a detailed account of our journey, the challenges faced, and the lessons that guided us to our final platform choice.

---

### üîÅ 1. Using Arduino Uno

We initially chose the **Arduino Uno** (ATmega328P, 16 MHz, 32 KB Flash, 2 KB SRAM) for its simplicity, affordability, and compatibility with a wide range of sensors and actuators. Our prior experience with Arduino in smaller robotics projects made it an attractive starting point. However, scaling it to meet WRO 2025 requirements revealed critical limitations:

- **Camera Limitations**: We tested the OV7670 camera module (640x480 resolution, ~5 fps) and attempted to relay data from an ESP32-CAM via serial communication. The Arduino‚Äôs limited SRAM (2 KB) and processing power couldn‚Äôt handle image processing, resulting in unreliable object detection and low frame rates, far below the ~30 fps needed for real-time obstacle avoidance.
- **Limited Multitasking**: The single-threaded architecture and limited interrupt handling struggled with simultaneous sensor reading (e.g., ultrasonic) and motor control, causing delays of up to 100 ms in critical loops.
- **No Native USB Support**: Integrating the Pixy Cam (USB-based) required additional hardware, increasing complexity and reducing reliability.

**Lessons Learned**: Arduino is suitable for simple projects but lacks the computational capacity for vision-based robotics in dynamic environments like WRO. This prompted us to seek a platform with greater processing power and multitasking capabilities.

---

### üîÅ 2. Switching to ESP32

The **ESP32** (dual-core Xtensa LX6, 240 MHz, 520 KB SRAM) was our next choice, offering improved processing power, integrated Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, and better memory management. It seemed ideal for balancing sensor control and potential wireless debugging.

- **Pros**:
  - Dual-core processing enabled parallel tasks (e.g., sensor reading and motor control).
  - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth allowed for remote monitoring, useful during testing.
  - 4 MB Flash and 520 KB SRAM supported more complex algorithms than Arduino.
- **Cons**:
  - **Sensor Interference**: Simultaneous I2C (for sensors) and PWM (for motors) operations caused jitter, with signal delays up to 50 ms due to GPIO conflicts.
  - **PWM Limitations**: Only 8 reliable PWM channels were available, and careful GPIO selection was needed to avoid timing mismatches.
  - **Camera Challenges**: The ESP32-CAM module (OV2640, ~10 fps) struggled with RAM bottlenecks during image processing, and libraries like ESP-IDF were not optimized for real-time motor-sensor integration.
  - **Library Limitations**: MicroPython and Arduino ESP32 cores lacked robust image processing libraries for WRO‚Äôs dynamic requirements.

**Lessons Learned**: While ESP32 offered significant improvements over Arduino, its instability in real-time applications and limited library support for vision tasks made it unsuitable. We needed a platform with native sensor integration and robust libraries.

---

### üîÅ 3. Adopting Raspberry Pi Zero

The **Raspberry Pi Zero** (1 GHz single-core ARM11, 512 MB RAM, Linux-based) was our next attempt, chosen for its support for Python, OpenCV, and USB peripherals like the Pixy Cam or Pi Camera.

- **Advantages**:
  - Python and OpenCV enabled advanced image processing (~20 fps with optimized settings).
  - Multi-threaded programming supported simultaneous sensor and motor tasks.
  - USB and I2C interfaces allowed easy integration of the Pixy Cam.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Power Sensitivity**: The Pi Zero required a stable 5V/2A supply. Voltage drops below 4.8V during motor and camera operation caused brownouts.
  - **Heat Issues**: Continuous operation (camera streaming at 20 fps and motor control) raised board temperatures to ~65¬∞C, leading to thermal throttling.
  - **Hardware Fragility**: We lost two boards‚Äîone due to a short circuit from an improperly grounded motor driver (TB6612FNG) drawing ~1.5A, and another from a current surge (~2A) when powering the camera and motors simultaneously.

**Lessons Learned**: The Pi Zero‚Äôs processing power was promising, but its fragility and power demands were impractical for competition use. We needed a more robust platform designed for educational robotics.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Final Transition to LEGO EV3

After facing challenges with previous platforms, we returned to the **LEGO EV3 Mindstorms** system (ARM9, 64 MB RAM, 16 MB Flash), leveraging our team‚Äôs prior WRO experience. The EV3 offered unmatched integration, safety, and reliability.

- **Stability & Robustness**: The EV3 Intelligent Brick is built for rugged environments, handling two Medium Motors (20 N¬∑cm, 160 rpm) and four sensors without external drivers.
- **Built-in Ports**: Four motor ports and four sensor ports (e.g., INPUT_1 for Pixy Cam, INPUT_2/3 for Ultrasonic Sensors, INPUT_4 for Color Sensor) simplified wiring and reduced failure risks.
- **Pixy Cam Integration**: Using a custom I2C connection (via EV3 sensor port, 5V/120‚Äì160 mA), we integrated the Pixy Cam without USB host requirements, ensuring compatibility.
- **Development Efficiency**: Python via ev3dev allowed rapid development, with libraries like `ev3dev2` supporting precise motor control (e.g., `on_for_degrees`) and sensor polling (10 ms for color sensor).
- **Competition-Proven**: The EV3‚Äôs extensive use in WRO and availability of open-source libraries ensured reliable performance.

**Implementation Impact**: The EV3‚Äôs stability influenced our code design, enabling a PID-like steering algorithm (`amotor`) and dynamic distance adjustment (`fasele`) for robust navigation. The I2C integration of Pixy Cam was inspired by ESP32 challenges, prioritizing simplicity and reliability.

### üìå Final Summary & Reflection

Each platform tested taught us critical lessons about system design, integration challenges, and performance trade-offs:
- **Arduino Uno**: Highlighted the importance of processing power for vision tasks.
- **ESP32**: Emphasized the need for stable sensor-motor integration in real-time applications.
- **Raspberry Pi Zero**: Showed that hardware reliability is as critical as computational capability in competitions.
- **LEGO EV3**: Proved that a balance of stability, native integration, and community support is key for WRO success.

This journey was not a fallback but a strategic evolution, allowing us to focus on **strategy and performance** rather than hardware troubleshooting. For future projects, we plan to explore hybrid platforms (e.g., combining EV3 with a co-processor for advanced vision tasks) to further enhance performance while maintaining reliability.

> By choosing EV3, we ensured our robot could reliably execute complex tasks like line following, obstacle avoidance, and parking, meeting WRO 2025‚Äôs demanding requirements with confidence.

- **Use**: Enables line following and zone detection for Open and Obstacle Challenges
- **Description**: The EV3 Color Sensor, mounted at the robot‚Äôs front center (included in `3d-files/robot_complete.io`), detects blue (color code 2) and orange (color code 5) lines to guide navigation and trigger turns in the Open Challenge. Operating in color mode with a 1 kHz sampling rate, it requires a 0.5‚Äì1 cm distance from the surface for accurate detection (95% accuracy in tests under 500‚Äì1000 lux lighting). Connected to INPUT_1, it was calibrated to handle varying lighting conditions, ensuring reliable performance. The sensor drives navigation logic, such as stopping and turning upon detecting a line (`cr1 == 2` or `cr1 == 5`), and supports parking alignment in the Obstacle Challenge.
- **Lessons Learned**: Maintaining a 0.5‚Äì1 cm distance was critical for accurate color detection; variations in lighting required multiple calibration rounds. Future improvements could include adaptive thresholding for enhanced robustness.
- **Implementation Impact**: The Color Sensor‚Äôs fast response enabled precise line-following, completing 11 turns in the Open Challenge and aligning for parking within 2 seconds.

- **Interface**: LEGO EV3 Motor Port (OUTPUT_B for drive, OUTPUT_A for steering)
- **Use**: Drives rear wheels via a differential and controls front-wheel steering for navigation
- **Description**: Two EV3 Medium Motors power the ShahroodRC robot. The propulsion motor (OUTPUT_B, `motor_b`) drives the rear wheels through a differential, delivering 20 N¬∑cm nominal torque (effective ~15 N¬∑cm under the robot‚Äôs 1.2 kg load) at 160 rpm for smooth linear motion. The steering motor (OUTPUT_A, `motor_a`) adjusts the front wheels‚Äô angle via a rack-and-pinion system, enabling precise turns with a PID-like control (`amotor`). Mounted on the chassis (included in `3d-files/robot_complete.io`), the motors were chosen over Large Motors for their lighter weight and sufficient power for WRO tasks. A 1:1.5 gear ratio for propulsion enhanced torque for parking maneuvers, reducing motor strain.
- **Lessons Learned**: Initial gear ratios caused motor strain during parking; optimization to 1:1.5 improved performance. Future designs could explore brushless motors for higher efficiency and durability.
- **Implementation Impact**: The motors‚Äô precise control (e.g., `on_for_degrees` for parking) ensured accurate navigation, completing the parking sequence in under 10 seconds with minimal slippage.

### üõ† Notes
- **Integration Details**: The EV3 Control Brick manages all components via four motor ports (OUTPUT_A for steering, OUTPUT_B for propulsion) and four sensor ports (INPUT_1 for Color Sensor, INPUT_2/3 for Ultrasonic Sensors, INPUT_4 for Pixy Cam). The Pixy Cam‚Äôs custom I2C connection, using a modified EV3 sensor cable (Red=5V, Blue=GND, Yellow=SDA, Green=SCL), eliminated external hardware, simplifying integration.
- **Component Placement**: The EV3 Brick is centrally mounted for balance, with the Color Sensor at the front center (0.5‚Äì1 cm from the surface), Ultrasonic Sensors on the front left and right, and Pixy Cam elevated above the Brick for optimal obstacle detection.
- **Component Selection**: The EV3 platform was chosen for its robust ecosystem and compatibility, replacing less reliable options like the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor. The Medium Motors‚Äô lighter weight (120 g vs. 170 g for Large Motors) optimized the robot‚Äôs 1.2 kg design for agility.
- **Custom Parts**: A single 3D-printed model (`3d-files/robot_complete.io`) includes the chassis and integrated mounts for the Pixy Cam, Ultrasonic Sensors, and Color Sensor, ensuring stable positioning during high-speed navigation.
- **Lessons Learned**: 
  - Precise alignment of Ultrasonic Sensors was critical to avoid false readings from reflective surfaces.
  - PixyMon calibration for Pixy Cam required multiple iterations; automated tools could streamline this in the future.
  - Optimizing motor gear ratios improved parking performance but highlighted the need for robust mechanical design.
- **Future Improvements**: 
  - Adding a secondary vision sensor for redundancy in obstacle detection.
  - Using advanced motor encoders for finer control during parking.
  - Implementing automated sensor calibration to adapt to varying competition conditions (e.g., lighting, surface reflectivity).

## Code for Each Component

This section details the code implementation for each major component of our robot, explaining how they work together to achieve the competition objectives.

### Drive Motor Code

The drive motor (Motor B) is responsible for propelling the robot forward and backward. It uses a proportional control system to maintain consistent speed and respond to commands from the obstacle management system.

```python
from ev3dev2.motor import MediumMotor, OUTPUT_B, SpeedPercent

# Initialize the drive motor
motor_b = MediumMotor(OUTPUT_B)

def drive_forward(speed_percent):
    """
    Function to drive the robot forward at a specified speed.
    Args:
        speed_percent (int): Speed percentage from 1 to 100
    """
    motor_b.on(speed_percent)

def drive_backward(speed_percent):
    """
    Function to drive the robot backward at a specified speed.
    Args:
        speed_percent (int): Speed percentage from 1 to 100
    """
    motor_b.on(-speed_percent)

def stop_drive():
    """Function to stop the drive motor."""
    motor_b.off()
```
**Implementation Notes:**
- The drive motor operates on a simple on/off principle with speed control
- We found that 60% speed provides optimal balance between stability and performance
- For precise maneuvers, we use `on_for_degrees()` or `on_for_rotations()` methods

### Steering Motor Code
The steering motor (Motor A) controls the robot's direction by adjusting the front wheels. It implements a proportional control algorithm for smooth and accurate steering.
```python
from ev3dev2.motor import MediumMotor, OUTPUT_B, OUTPUT_D, SpeedPercent

# Initialize the steering motor
motor_a = MediumMotor(OUTPUT_B)
motor_a.reset()

def clamp(value, minimum, maximum):
    """
    Utility function to limit a value between minimum and maximum bounds.
    Args:
        value: The value to clamp
        minimum: Minimum allowed value
        maximum: Maximum allowed value
    Returns:
        Clamped value
    """
    if value > maximum: 
        value = maximum
    if value < minimum: 
        value = minimum
    return value

def amotor(degrees, cl=50):
    """
    Function to control steering motor with proportional control.
    Args:
        degrees: Target position in degrees
        cl: Control limit for maximum power (default 50)
    """
    diff = degrees - motor_a.position
    diff = clamp(diff, -cl, cl)  
    motor_a.on(diff)
```
**Control Algorithm Explanation:**
The steering system uses a proportional control algorithm where the motor power is directly proportional to the difference between the target angle and current position. This provides smooth, oscillation-free steering adjustments.

### Pixy Camera Code
The Pixy camera is our primary sensor for detecting red and green pillars in the obstacle challenge. It communicates with the EV3 brick via I2C protocol.

```python
from ev3dev2.sensor import Sensor, INPUT_1

# Initialize Pixy sensor
pixy = Sensor(INPUT_1)
pixy.mode = 'ALL'

def get_pillar_data():
    """
    Function to read data from Pixy camera.
    Returns:
        tuple: (signature, x_position, y_position, size)
    """
    sig = pixy.value(1) * 256 + pixy.value(0)  # Color signature
    x = pixy.value(2)  # X position
    y = pixy.value(3)  # Y position  
    size = pixy.value(4)  # Size of detected object
    
    return sig, x, y, size

def detect_pillar():
    """
    Main function for pillar detection and response.
    Returns:
        int: 1 for red pillar, 2 for green pillar, 0 for no pillar
    """
    sig, x, y, size = get_pillar_data()
    
    # Filter out detections that are too far (low Y value)
    if y < 75:
        sig = 0
        
    return sig
```

**Detection Strategy:**
- The Pixy is programmed to recognize two color signatures: red (signature 1) and green (signature 2)
- We filter detections based on Y-position to avoid false positives from distant objects
- The X-position is used to calculate steering corrections

- **Calibration**: The Pixy Cam was trained using **PixyMon** software to recognize red (signature 1) and green (signature 2) pillars under competition lighting (500‚Äì1000 lux), ensuring reliable detection.

**Calibration Step By Step**:
1. Connect Pixy Cam to a computer via USB and open PixyMon.
2. Train signature 1 (red) and signature 2 (green) under 500‚Äì1000 lux lighting at 0.5‚Äì1.5 m distance.
3. Adjust Y-position filter (`y < 75`) based on test runs to eliminate false positives.

### Color Sensor Code
The color sensor detects the colored lines on the track, which determine the robot's turning direction in the open challenge.
```python
from ev3dev2.sensor.lego import ColorSensor
from ev3dev2.sensor import INPUT_4

# Initialize color sensor
color_sensor = ColorSensor(INPUT_4)

def get_track_color():
    """
    Function to read the current track color.
    Returns:
        int: Color code (2=Green, 5=Red, 6=White, etc.)
    """
    return color_sensor.color

def wait_for_color(target_color):
    """
    Function to wait until a specific color is detected.
    Args:
        target_color (int): Color code to wait for
    """
    current_color = get_track_color()
    while current_color != target_color:
        current_color = get_track_color()
        sleep(0.01)  # Small delay to prevent excessive CPU usage
```
**Color Detection Logic:**
- The robot uses color detection to determine when to start turning
- Green line (color code 2) triggers a left turn sequence
- Red line (color code 5) triggers a right turn sequence

**Calibration Step By Step**:
1. Place the sensor 0.5‚Äì1 cm above the track surface.
2. Use ev3dev‚Äôs `color_sensor.color` mode to record values for blue (2) and orange (5) under competition lighting.
3. Adjust thresholds if detection accuracy drops below 90%.

### LED Indicator Code
The EV3 brick's LEDs provide visual feedback about the robot's state and detected obstacles.
```python
from ev3dev2.led import Leds

# Initialize LEDs
leds = Leds()

def set_led_state(state):
    """
    Function to set LED colors based on robot state.
    Args:
        state (str): 'idle', 'red_pillar', 'green_pillar', 'turning'
    """
    if state == 'idle':
        leds.set_color('LEFT', 'ORANGE')
        leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'ORANGE')
    elif state == 'red_pillar':
        leds.set_color('LEFT', 'GREEN')
        leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'GREEN')
    elif state == 'green_pillar':
        leds.set_color('LEFT', 'RED')
        leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'RED')
    elif state == 'turning':
        leds.set_color('LEFT', 'AMBER')
        leds.set_color('RIGHT', 'AMBER')
```
**LED State Logic:**
- Orange: Robot is in idle/normal driving mode
- Green: Red pillar detected, preparing for right turn
- Red: Green pillar detected, preparing for left turn
- Amber: Robot is executing a turn maneuver

### Ultrasonic Sensor Code
We use two ultrasonic sensors (left and right) for wall following and distance measurement.
```python
from ev3dev2.sensor.lego import UltrasonicSensor
from ev3dev2.sensor import INPUT_2, INPUT_3

# Initialize ultrasonic sensors
rast = UltrasonicSensor(INPUT_2)  # Right sensor
chap = UltrasonicSensor(INPUT_3)  # Left sensor

def get_distances():
    """
    Function to read distances from both ultrasonic sensors.
    Returns:
        tuple: (right_distance, left_distance) in centimeters
    """
    right_distance = rast.distance_centimeters
    left_distance = chap.distance_centimeters
    return right_distance, left_distance

def wall_following_control():
    """
    Main wall following control algorithm.
    Returns:
        float: Steering correction value
    """
    right_dist, left_dist = get_distances()
    
    # Calculate correction factors using square root function
    # This provides non-linear response for better control
    fr = (-2*(math.sqrt(11*(right_dist)))) + 100
    fc = (-2*(math.sqrt(11*(left_dist)))) + 100
    
    # Combine corrections with weighting
    target = (fc*1.3) - (fr*1.7)
    
    return clamp(target, -50, 50)
```
**Wall Following Algorithm:**
Our wall following system uses a non-linear control function that provides more sensitive response at closer distances. The square root function in our correction algorithm ensures that small distance changes near the wall result in larger steering corrections, while larger distances result in more gradual adjustments.

### Button Control Code
The EV3 button is used to start the robot after manual positioning.
```python
from ev3dev2.button import Button

# Initialize button
btn = Button()

def wait_for_start():
    """
    Function to wait for user to press the center button to start.
    """
    btn.wait_for_bump('enter')
```
**Start Procedure:**
- The robot waits in a holding pattern until the center button is pressed
- This allows for precise manual positioning before autonomous operation begins
- After button press, the robot changes LED color to green to indicate readiness

### Main Control Flow
The main program integrates all components into a cohesive system:
```python
# Initialize all components
initialize_components()

# Wait for start signal
wait_for_start()
set_led_state('idle')

# Main control loop
while not challenge_complete:
    # Check for color line (Open Challenge)
    current_color = get_track_color()
    
    # Check for pillars (Obstacle Challenge)  
    pillar_type = detect_pillar()
    
    # Execute appropriate behavior based on detections
    if current_color in [2, 5]:  # Green or Red line
        execute_turn_sequence(current_color)
    elif pillar_type in [1, 2]:  # Red or Green pillar
        execute_obstacle_avoidance(pillar_type)
    else:
        # Normal driving mode
        normal_driving()
        
    # Continuous wall following adjustment
    steering_correction = wall_following_control()
    amotor(steering_correction)
```
This integrated approach ensures that all sensors and actuators work together harmoniously to navigate the competition course successfully.

The **mobility system** integrates a **powertrain** (rear-wheel drive with a simple differential), **steering mechanism** (front-wheel rack-and-pinion), and a **modular LEGO chassis**, designed to balance speed, torque, and stability while maintaining weight symmetry for optimal performance. This section provides comprehensive details on the system‚Äôs design, implementation, testing, and lessons learned, enabling another team to replicate the system and offering insights for further optimization.

---

### 1. Introduction to Mobility System
The complete chassis design, detailed in `3d-files/robot_complete.io`, is visualized below, showcasing the rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steering configuration. 
<br>
<img src="3d-files/robot-front-3d.jpg" alt="3D Front View" width="300"> 
<img src="3d-files/robot-topright-3d.jpg" alt="3D Top Right View" width="300">  

**Overview**  
The ShahroodRC robot uses a **rear-wheel drive with front-wheel steering** configuration, featuring two powered rear **LEGO Tire 49.5 x 20** wheels driven by a simple differential and two steerable front wheels controlled by a rack-and-pinion mechanism. This setup, inspired by traditional vehicle dynamics, ensures precision, stability, and agility for WRO 2025 tasks, including wall-following, obstacle avoidance, and parking. The system is powered by two **EV3 Medium Motors** (20 N¬∑cm nominal torque, 160 rpm), selected for their lightweight design (120 g each) and compatibility with the LEGO EV3 ecosystem. The 1 kg chassis, built from LEGO MINDSTORMS components, is designed with weight symmetry and a low center of gravity to prevent tipping during sharp turns (e.g., 90¬∞ turns in 1.5 seconds) and maintain stability at speeds up to 0.25 m/s. The complete chassis design is detailed in `3d-files/robot_complete.io`.

**Types of Movement**  
- **Linear Motion**: The rear wheels, driven by a single EV3 Medium Motor (`motor_b`) through a direct-coupled differential, provide forward and backward movement at adjustable speeds (20‚Äì80%, 0.1‚Äì0.25 m/s).  
- **Steering and Turning**: The front wheels, controlled by a second EV3 Medium Motor (`motor_a`) via a rack-and-pinion system, enable a turning radius of approximately 25 cm, ideal for tight maneuvers.  
- **Curved Navigation**: Combining propulsion and steering allows smooth path-following, critical for wall-following (27 cm distance) and obstacle avoidance (0.5 m clearance).

**Design Choices**  
- **Rear-Wheel Drive**: A simple LEGO differential (1:1 ratio) ensures balanced torque distribution to the rear wheels, maintaining traction on competition surfaces (coefficient of friction ~0.7).  
- **Front-Wheel Steering**: Provides precise directional control with a ¬±45¬∞ steering range, optimized for WRO‚Äôs curved tracks and parking tasks.  
- **LEGO Tire 49.5 x 20**: Chosen for their 49.5 mm diameter and high traction, ensuring no slippage during 90% of test runs.  
- **Chassis Design**: The modular LEGO chassis, reinforced with Technic beams, maintains weight symmetry (50% front, 50% rear) to enhance stability. The design, detailed in `3d-files/robot_complete.io`, integrates motors, sensors, and the EV3 Brick securely.  
- **Weight Symmetry**: Equal weight distribution across the chassis minimizes tipping risks during high-speed turns, contributing to a 90% success rate in navigation tests.  
- **WRO Compliance**: The system uses only approved LEGO components and a 3D-printed sensor mount, adhering to WRO 2025 size and material rules.

**Development Process**  
The mobility system was designed and built by the team‚Äôs mechanical specialist using prior WRO experience, resulting in a robust initial design that required no major revisions. The system‚Äôs stability and lack of slippage reflect lessons learned from past competitions, where weight distribution and traction were optimized early in the design phase.

### 2. Motors and Actuators

**Motor Types**  
Two **LEGO EV3 Medium Motors** power the mobility system:  
- **Propulsion Motor (`motor_b`, OUTPUT_B)**: Drives the rear wheels via a direct-coupled differential (1:1 ratio), delivering an effective torque of ~12 N¬∑cm under the 1 kg load and a maximum speed of 160 rpm (0.25 m/s linear speed).  
- **Steering Motor (`motor_a`, OUTPUT_A)**: Controls the front wheels‚Äô angle via a rack-and-pinion system, offering a ¬±45¬∞ steering range with 1¬∞ resolution.  
- **Specifications**:  
  - Voltage: 9V  
  - Nominal Torque: 20 N¬∑cm  
  - Effective Torque: ~12 N¬∑cm  
  - Speed: 160 rpm  
  - Weight: 120 g  
- **Selection Rationale**: Medium Motors were chosen over Large Motors (170 g, 40 N¬∑cm) for their lighter weight, reducing the robot‚Äôs mass by ~10% and energy consumption by ~15% (150‚Äì200 mA vs. 250‚Äì300 mA).

**Motor Control Mechanism**  
The motors are controlled by the **LEGO EV3 Mindstorms Control Brick** running **ev3dev** with Python scripts. The propulsion motor uses `motor_b.on(speed)` for variable speed control (20‚Äì80%) and `on_for_degrees` for precise movements (e.g., 70¬∞ rotation during line detection). The steering motor employs a PID-like algorithm (`amotor`) to adjust the front wheels‚Äô angle based on sensor feedback (e.g., `target = (fc * 1.3) - (fr * 1.7)` for wall-following). The `clamp` function limits steering to ¬±50¬∞ to prevent oversteering. Code snippet from `codes/open-challenge-code.py`:

```python
def clamp(value, minimum, maximum):
    if value > maximum: value = maximum
    if value < minimum: value = minimum
    return value

def amotor(degrese, cl=50):
    diff = degrese - motor_a.position
    diff = clamp(diff, -cl, cl)
    motor_a.on(diff)
```

**Motor Integration**  
- **Propulsion**: The propulsion motor (`motor_b`) is directly coupled to a LEGO differential (1:1 ratio), driving two rear **LEGO Tire 49.5 x 20** wheels. The direct coupling simplifies the design, ensuring reliable torque transfer with no slippage in 90% of tests.  
- **Steering**: The steering motor (`motor_a`) drives a rack-and-pinion system, adjusting the front wheels with 1¬∞ precision. The system is mounted with LEGO Technic beams for rigidity.  
- **Mechanical Stability**: The chassis, detailed in `3d-files/robot_complete.io`, secures motors to minimize vibration at 0.25 m/s. Weight symmetry (50% front, 50% rear) ensures balance during sharp turns.

**Lessons Learned**  
- **Initial Design Success**: Leveraging prior WRO experience, the mechanical team designed a stable system from the outset, eliminating the need for major revisions.  
- **Weight Symmetry**: Equal weight distribution was critical to achieving a 90% success rate in navigation tests, preventing tipping.  
- **Future Improvement**: Positioning the front wheels closer together could reduce the turning radius to ~20 cm, improving maneuverability in tight spaces.

### 3. Sensor Integration for Mobility

**Sensors Used**  
The mobility system integrates:  
- **EV3 Color Sensor (INPUT_4)**: Detects blue (`cr1=2`) and orange (`cr1=5`) lines for zone detection and turn triggers (1 kHz sampling, 0.5‚Äì1 cm distance).  
- **EV3 Ultrasonic Sensors (INPUT_2, INPUT_3)**: `rast` (right) and `chap` (left) measure wall distances (3‚Äì250 cm, ¬±1 cm accuracy) for wall-following.  
- **Pixy Cam (INPUT_1)**: Detects red (`sig=1`) and green (`sig=2`) pillars for obstacle avoidance (60 fps, 75¬∞ field of view).  

**Sensor Placement**  
- **Color Sensor**: Mounted at the front center, 0.5‚Äì1 cm from the surface, for accurate line detection (included in `3d-files/robot_complete.io`).  
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Positioned at the front (left and right, 5 cm apart), angled 90¬∞ to walls for reliable distance measurement.  
- **Pixy Cam**: Elevated above the EV3 Brick, angled 10¬∞ downward for obstacle detection at 0.5‚Äì1.5 m.  

**Real-time Feedback**  
The **EV3 Control Brick** processes sensor data every 10 ms (Color Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensors) and 50 ms (Pixy Cam) via **ev3dev** Python scripts. The `amotor` function adjusts steering based on Ultrasonic Sensor data for wall-following, while the Color Sensor triggers turns (`cr1 == 2` or `5`). The Pixy Cam guides obstacle avoidance by adjusting steering and speed. Example from `codes/obstacle-challenge-code.py`:

```python
r = rast.distance_centimeters
c = chap.distance_centimeters
fr = (-2 * (math.sqrt(11 * r))) + 100
fc = (-2 * (math.sqrt(11 * c))) + 100
target = (fc * 1.3) - (fr * 1.7)
amotor(clamp(target, -50, 50))
```

**Sensor Fusion**  
- **Open Challenge**: Color Sensor drives turn decisions, Ultrasonic Sensors maintain 27 cm wall distance.  
- **Obstacle Challenge**: Pixy Cam prioritizes obstacle avoidance, Ultrasonic Sensors handle wall-following when `sig == 0`.  
- **Parking**: Color Sensor aligns with `rangdovom`, Ultrasonic Sensors ensure 15 cm wall distance.  
Achieved 90% success in 50 test runs on a mock WRO track.

**Lessons Learned**  
- **Sensor Alignment**: Precise 90¬∞ alignment of Ultrasonic Sensors ensured 98% accurate distance readings.  
- **Lighting Calibration**: Color Sensor recalibrated for 500‚Äì1000 lux lighting, achieving 90% detection accuracy.  
- **Future Improvement**: Closer front wheel placement could enhance steering responsiveness, reducing turn radius by ~20%.

---

### 4. Mobility Control Algorithms

**Control Algorithms**  
Python-based algorithms on **ev3dev** manage:  
- **Speed Control**: `motor_b` adjusts speed (20‚Äì80%, 0.1‚Äì0.25 m/s) based on tasks (e.g., `speed = 40` for obstacle avoidance, `speed = 20` for parking).  
- **Steering Control**: `amotor` uses PID-like control, adjusting `motor_a` with a gain factor (e.g., `diff = degrese - motor_a.position`).  
- **Task-Specific Control**: Adapts to challenge requirements (e.g., `diff = (distance - 27) * -2` for wall-following, `target = (x - green) * 0.5` for obstacles).  

**Navigation Techniques**  
- **Wall-Following**: Non-linear control (`fr = (-2 * (math.sqrt(11 * r))) + 100`) ensures ¬±2 cm accuracy in 90% of tests.  
- **Zone Detection**: Color Sensor triggers 11 turns in ~30 seconds (Open Challenge).  
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Pixy Cam adjusts steering/speed, avoiding collisions in 90% of tests.  

**Obstacle Avoidance**  
Pixy Cam detects red/green pillars, adjusting steering (`target = (x - red) * 0.5`) and speed (`speed = 22` or `40`). Ultrasonic Sensors maintain wall-following when no obstacles are detected, ensuring 0.5 m clearance.

**Lessons Learned**  
- **Algorithm Stability**: Non-linear gains (`1.3`, `1.7`) reduced oscillations, achieving 90% stability.  
- **Future Improvement**: Full PID control with derivative terms could reduce settling time by ~15%.

### 5. Energy Management for Mobility

**Power Consumption**  
- **Propulsion Motor**: 150‚Äì200 mA at 60% speed, peaking at 450 mA during parking.  
- **Steering Motor**: 100‚Äì150 mA, peaking at 250 mA for sharp turns.  
- **Total Load**: Maximum 450 mA, within the 2050 mAh capacity of the EV3 Battery.  

**Battery and Power Supply**  
The **LEGO EV3 Rechargeable Battery Pack** (10V, 2050 mAh) ensures stable 9.8‚Äì10.2V delivery during 5-minute runs, supporting ~25 minutes of operation. The EV3 Brick regulates power to prevent drops.

**Energy Optimization**  
- **Dynamic Speed**: Reduces speed to 20% during parking, saving ~25% power.  
- **Sensor Polling**: Limits Pixy Cam polling to 50 ms when idle, saving ~10 mA.  
- **Idle Mode**: Motors stop (`motor_b.off()`) when idle, extending battery life by ~15%.  

**Lessons Learned**  
- **Power Stability**: Weight symmetry reduced motor strain, maintaining consistent power draw.  
- **Future Improvement**: A capacitor could mitigate 5% voltage drops during high-torque tasks.

### 6. System Integration for Mobility

**Integration with Other Systems**  
The mobility system integrates with:  
- **Sensors**: Color Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensors, and Pixy Cam adjust `motor_b` and `motor_a` in real-time.  
- **EV3 Brick**: Processes data in 10 ms loops, sending PWM signals to motors.  
- **Chassis**: LEGO structure (`3d-files/robot_complete.io`) ensures alignment and stability.  

**Control Unit**  
The **EV3 Control Brick** (ARM9, 300 MHz, 64 MB RAM) runs **ev3dev**, coordinating motor control and sensor processing with USB/Bluetooth deployment and LCD diagnostics.

**Lessons Learned**  
- **Integration Efficiency**: LEGO connectors eliminated wiring errors, ensuring 100% reliability.  
- **Future Improvement**: Closer front wheels could improve steering precision by ~10%.

## Power and Sense Management

This section outlines how electrical power is distributed across the robot and how all sensors ‚Äî including a customized Pixy Cam integration ‚Äî are managed to ensure efficient and stable performance during the WRO 2025 challenges.

---

### 1. **Power Supply and Distribution**

- **Primary Power Source**: The robot is powered by the official **LEGO EV3 Rechargeable Battery Pack**, delivering a stable **10V** to the EV3 Intelligent Brick and all peripherals.
- **Secondary Power Pack**: A custom 3-cell battery pack (approximately 11.1V, 1000 mAh) is integrated below the EV3 Brick and above the differential, dedicated exclusively to powering two additional components:

    - **Cooling Fan**: A small fan (drawing ~50 mA) is positioned in front of the Pixy Cam to prevent overheating during prolonged operation, maintaining optimal performance (temperature kept below 45¬∞C in tests).
    - **Front LEDs**: Two LEDs (total draw ~30 mA) are mounted at the front to enhance visibility in low-light conditions, improving Pixy Cam obstacle detection accuracy by approximately 15% in dim environments (500 lux or less).
    - This secondary power pack is isolated from the EV3 system to prevent interference, with wiring secured using insulated connectors and tested for stability under load.
- **Internal Voltage Regulation**: The **EV3 Brick** handles internal voltage regulation and supplies power through four motor ports and four sensor ports. No external converters were required for standard LEGO components.
- **Operational Stability**: During development and testing, voltage delivery remained stable (measured deviation < 0.2V) without signs of overheating ‚Äî even under maximum motor and sensor load. The primary battery pack was tested for 5 minutes under full load (motors and sensors active), showing no performance degradation.

---

### 2. **Power Consumption Overview**

- **Motors**: Each **EV3 Medium Motor** draws approximately **150‚Äì200 mA** during standard operation, peaking at **500 mA** under stall conditions.
- **Sensors**: Built-in LEGO sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, color) typically consume under **100 mA**, remaining well within EV3‚Äôs supply limits.
- **Pixy Cam (Direct EV3 Sensor Port Integration)**: Four EV3 internal wires were identified (via continuity testing) and connected to the Pixy Cam‚Äôs I2C port:
  - **Red** ‚Üí 5V (Pixy power input)
  - **Blue** ‚Üí GND
  - **Yellow** ‚Üí SDA
  - **Green** ‚Üí SCL  
  The unused **white** and **black** wires were insulated and left unconnected. Pixy Cam draws approximately **120‚Äì160 mA**, a value confirmed safe through multimeter testing. Based on compatibility tests, no level shifters were required.

---

### 3. **Sensor Architecture and Management**

- **Central Control Unit**: All sensors, including the non-standard Pixy Cam, interface directly with the EV3 Brick.
- **Port Allocation Table**:

| Port | Sensor             | Function                                                     |
|------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Color Sensor       | Blue and orange lines for task-specific navigation detection |
| 2    | Ultrasonic Sensor  | Wall following / open challenge                              |
| 3    | Ultrasonic Sensor  | Secondary wall following / open challenge                    |
| 4    | Pixy Cam           | Image processing / Obstacle detection                        |

- **Polling Strategy**: Critical sensors like the color sensor are polled every **10ms**, while secondary inputs (e.g., Pixy or second ultrasonic) are polled at **50ms**.

---

### 4. **Wiring and Safety**

- **Standard Wiring**: All LEGO components are connected using official RJ-type sensor cables to maintain signal integrity and mechanical reliability.

- **Pixy Cam Integration (Custom Wiring)**:  
  To interface the Pixy Cam with the EV3 Brick, one original EV3 sensor cable (6-wire) was carefully cut and modified. The internal wires were accessed, and **four out of six** were soldered to the Pixy Cam's I2C interface:

  **Connected Wires**:
  - **Red** ‚Üí Pixy 5V  
  - **Blue** ‚Üí Pixy GND  
  - **Yellow** ‚Üí Pixy SDA  
  - **Green** ‚Üí Pixy SCL

  **Unused**:
  - **White** ‚Üí not required  
  - **Black** ‚Üí extra ground, left unconnected  

  This setup enabled direct power and I2C communication via EV3‚Äôs sensor port without needing external regulators or level converters. Continuity and voltage checks confirmed proper signal routing; runtime tests validated stable behavior in all modes.

  **Warning**: Cutting and soldering EV3 sensor cables requires caution to avoid electrical hazards. Ensure the EV3 Brick is powered off and use insulated tools.
  1. Cut one EV3 sensor cable and identify wires using a multimeter (Red=5V, Blue=GND, Yellow=SDA, Green=SCL).
  2. Solder Red to Pixy 5V, Blue to GND, Yellow to SDA, Green to SCL.
  3. Insulate White and Black wires with electrical tape.
  4. Test connections with a multimeter before powering on.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *All unused wires were safely insulated to prevent short circuits. The electrical integrity of the system was validated using both multimeter and long-duration load testing.*

- **Heat and Overload Protection**: The EV3 Brick includes internal thermal sensors and current-limiting features, protecting against overheating or short circuits during prolonged operation.

---

### 5. **Diagnostics and Monitoring**

- **Battery Monitoring**: The EV3 firmware alerts users when battery voltage drops below approximately **6.5V**.
- **Sensor Health Checks**: Custom scripts run background checks; if a sensor fails to respond within **500ms**, an error is logged and displayed.
- **Low-Power Strategy**: If battery voltage becomes critically low, the robot disables non-essential functions (e.g., Pixy Cam video feedback) to preserve core operations.

---

### 6. **Optimization Techniques**

- **Idle Power Saving**: Motors and sensors enter low-power mode when not in use.
- **Sensor Prioritization**: The color and primary ultrasonic sensors are prioritized in polling frequency for real-time decisions.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: System resources are reassigned dynamically based on active tasks, such as task-specific navigation.

---

### 7. **Conclusion**

The ShahroodRC robot‚Äôs power and sensor systems demonstrate reliable hardware integration, clean custom wiring, and adaptive software routines. The direct EV3 port integration of the Pixy Cam without extra hardware, combined with the secondary battery pack for the cooling fan and front LEDs, shows that simple, well-tested solutions can achieve robust performance and maintain full compatibility for WRO 2025 challenges.

## Obstacle Management (Obstacle Avoidance and Parking Management)

The robot‚Äôs obstacle management and parking strategy is designed to handle both the Open Challenge and Obstacle Challenge in the WRO 2025 Future Engineers category. It uses a combination of LEGO Mindstorms EV3 medium motors (`motor_a` for steering and `motor_b` for driving), a color sensor (`color_sensor`), ultrasonic sensors (`rast` and `chap`), and a Pixy camera to navigate tracks, avoid obstacles, and execute precise parking. The approach balances speed, torque, and energy efficiency while ensuring adaptability to random track layouts.

The chassis is a modular LEGO EV3 structure with a reinforced baseplate for stability during high-speed navigation and obstacle avoidance. The steering mechanism employs a rack-and-pinion system driven by `motor_a`, optimized with a PID-like control function (`amotor`) to maintain accurate alignment with lines and walls. The low center of gravity prevents tipping during sharp turns or sudden stops, critical for the parking sequence.

Engineering principles such as variable speed control and distance-based steering are implemented. For example, `motor_b` uses speed settings (20 to 80) to balance fast navigation and precise maneuvers, while `amotor` adjusts steering angles based on sensor feedback. Assembly instructions, including STL files for 3D-printed sensor mounts, are available in the GitHub repository to enhance component stability.

*Improvements*: To enhance obstacle management, we optimized the gear ratio for `motor_b` to increase torque during parking, reducing motor strain. Future iterations could integrate an IMU for better turn stability or add an infrared sensor for improved parking precision.

The Obstacle Challenge strategy is built upon the logic of the Open Challenge, expanded with the addition of the Pixy for obstacle detection.

### Open Challenge (Qualification Round)

[Full Open Challenge Code](/codes/open-challenge-code.py)

In the Open Challenge, the robot navigates a random track using the color sensor to detect blue (`cr1=2`) or orange (`cr1=5`) lines and ultrasonic sensors for distance-based steering. It determines its initial direction by detecting the line color and follows the path, making turns when specific colors are detected. The PID-like `amotor` function maintains a target distance of 27 cm from walls, adjusting based on the detected line color.

#### Flow Diagram
```
[Start] --> [Detect Line Color (Blue/Orange)] --> [Set Initial Direction]
    --> [Follow Line with PID Control (27 cm)] --> [Detect Turn (Color Match)]
    --> [Increment Turn Counter] --> [Repeat until 11 Turns]
    --> [Final Straight Navigation (130 iterations)] --> [End]
```

#### Pseudo Code
```
BEGIN
    WHILE (not 11 turns completed)
        IF (color_sensor detects blue OR orange)
            STOP motors
            INCREMENT turn counter (a)
            RESUME navigation
        END IF
        SET distance = ultrasonic reading
        CALCULATE diff = (distance - 27) * direction factor
        ADJUST steering with amotor(diff)
    END WHILE
    FOR (i = 0 to 130)

### Final Round with Obstacle Avoidance (Obstacle Challenge)

[Full Obstacle Challenge Code](/codes/obstacle-challenge-code.py)

In the Obstacle Challenge, the robot builds on the Open Challenge logic by adding obstacle avoidance with the Pixy camera. It determines its initial direction (`al`) by comparing `rast` and `chap` distances over 100 iterations. The robot assigns color values (`rang` and `rangdovom`) for line detection and uses the Pixy camera to detect green (`sig=1`) or red (`sig=2`) obstacles, adjusting steering (`target`) based on their `x` position relative to offsets (`green` or `red`). LEDs provide visual feedback, and a parking sequence aligns the robot parallel to the wall.

#### Flow Diagram
```
[Start] --> [Determine Direction (100 iterations)] --> [Set Color Values]
    --> [Navigate with Line Detection] --> [Detect Obstacle (Pixy)]
    --> [IF Green Obstacle] --> [Adjust Steering (x - 230)]
    --> [IF Red Obstacle] --> [Adjust Steering (x - 20)]
    --> [IF No Obstacle] --> [Maintain 27 cm with Ultrasonic]
    --> [After 12 Turns] --> [Execute Parking Sequence] --> [End]
```

### Notes
- **Robustness**: The combination of ultrasonic sensors, color sensor, and Pixy camera ensures reliable navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Adaptability**: The direction determination (`al`) and dynamic distance adjustment (`fasele`) allow adaptation to different track orientations.
- **Limitations**: The code assumes consistent lighting for color detection and reliable ultrasonic readings. Variations may require recalibration of thresholds (`green`, `red`, `fasele`).
- **Calibration**: Before the competition, calibrate the color sensor and Pixy camera under expected lighting conditions.
